# PCGS Verification Status

## Current Implementation
The app displays **placeholder PCGS certification numbers** for demo/UI purposes. These are NOT real, working certification numbers.

## What's Implemented
- ✅ PCGS API integration code
- ✅ API key configured in app.config.js
- ✅ UI displays certification badges on product pages
- ✅ Mock verification system shows certifications as "verified"
- ❌ NO real PCGS certification numbers in database

## Certification Number Format
Current: `PCGS-YYYY-GRADE-XXXXXXXX`
- Example: `PCGS-2024-MSB70-012345`

Real PCGS format would be 8-10 digit serial numbers for actual graded coins.

## To Use Real PCGS Data

1. **Get Real PCGS Numbers**: You need actual holder serial numbers from your inventory
2. **Update Products**: Replace placeholder cert_number values with real ones
3. **Test API**: The code is ready to call PCGS API once real numbers are in place

## Example Real PCGS Data Needed

For Morgan Silver Dollars (PCGS Registry #7145):
- Year
- Mint mark (P, S, D, O, CC)
- Grade (MS63, MS64, MS65, etc.)
- Real holder serial number (8-10 digits)

## Current Products Status

- Modern bullion coins: Placeholder certs added
- Morgan Dollars: Placeholder certs added  
- Peace Dollars: Placeholder certs added
- Ancient coins: Placeholder certs added

**All certification numbers are for display only and will NOT work with PCGS API calls.**
